## TODO APP - CRUD Practice

### CRUD

**CRUD** stands for:

- **C**reate
- **R**ead
- **U**pdate
- **D**elete

This is a pattern good for practicing state management.

In this practice repo, I used React's [createContext](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/createContext) API + the [useContext](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useContext) and [useReducer](https://beta.reactjs.org/reference/react/useReducer) hooks to take care of all my state logic for this project.

### This project was also built on:

- [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/create-nextjs-app)
- [Tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Tailwind + prettier](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/automatic-class-sorting-with-prettier)

### To run:

1. Switch to the nextjs directory `cd crud-todo-app`
2. Install dependencies `npm i`
3. Run the local server `npm run dev`
